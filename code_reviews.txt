This review is helpful, it doesn't just point out code that should be changed but also gives pointers, guidelines, and
examples on how it be changed. One example of this is the code provided for how the programmer would use enums, as well as
the link to Python's page on them. Also, the way the review suggest better documentation follows the code review principle
of ensuring maintability.
